# SCD Effort Reporting
This is a Django based web application for the Fermilab Scientific Computing Division.  It's intent is to allow employees to log and review daily/weekly/monthly effort reports. Staff memebers can entries describing work that was performed against different projects and categories and then then managers can review, filter, aggregate, summarize, preview, and export the parts of the data or full reports.

The application is designed to work in the Fermilab security environment and with the on premisses OKD cluster.  This makes it a lightweight, easily maintainable and deployable part of our portfolio.

**Current release: v01.00.00**

## Features

- **Effort entries** — submit and manage weekly/biweekly/monthly work entries with Markdown descriptions, tags, period dates, group assignment, and flags for privacy, criticality, and highlight rating (0–5 stars)
- **HTMX interactions** — period chip selector pre-fills date fields; tag autocomplete with chip UI; live Markdown preview; all without full page reloads
- **Role-based access** — six roles (User, Group Leader, Division Head, Functional Lead, Auditor, Administrator) with enforced permission checks throughout; group leaders and division heads see reports scoped to their managed groups
- **Reports** — admins, auditors, group leaders, division heads, and functional leads filter entries by author, project, category, and date range; preview results with per-row checkboxes to select a subset; download as plain text, CSV, JSON, XLSX, or PDF; report scope is automatically restricted to managed groups/projects for non-admin roles
- **AI Summary** — generate a structured narrative summary of any filtered or selected entries via the Anthropic API; download as plain text or PDF; system prompt and user template are editable from the web UI by admins
- **Audit log** — WorkItem create/update/delete/reassign/archive events, login/logout events, and report exports (including AI summaries) are recorded with actor, IP address, user-agent, and field-level diffs
- **Taxonomy management** — projects, categories, and organisational groups are managed through a tabbed web UI (Admin role required)
- **User management** — administrators can create accounts, assign roles, reset passwords, and delete users; group leaders and division heads see only their own group's members
- **API token management** — users can generate, rotate, and revoke personal API tokens from their profile; admins can view and revoke all tokens from a dedicated admin page
- **REST API** — authenticated entry creation via `POST /api/entries/` using a Bearer token; suitable for scripted or automated submission
- **Bug reporting** — authenticated users can submit bug reports directly to the GitHub repository from within the application; submissions use a GitHub App installation token (no personal credentials required) and are rate-limited per user
- **SSO** — local email/password auth via django-allauth; optional OIDC single sign-on (Fermilab Keycloak / CILogon); the SSO button appears only when OIDC credentials are configured

## Quickstart

The fastest way to get running — one command handles everything:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
git clone https://github.com/fermitools/SCD-Reporting.git
cd SCD-Reporting
./bootstrap.sh --admin-password yourpassword
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
git clone https://github.com/fermitools/SCD-Reporting.git
cd SCD-Reporting
.\bootstrap.ps1 -AdminPassword yourpassword
```

The script creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, migrates the database, seeds initial data, and starts the server at <http://localhost:8000>. Log in with `scd-admin@fnal.gov` and the password you provided.

To enable the AI Summary feature, pass your Anthropic API key:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh --admin-password yourpassword --anthropic-key sk-ant-...
```

For platform-specific prerequisites and manual setup steps see **[docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md)**.

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+ (optional — Tailwind falls back to the Play CDN in dev mode)
- Git

### Setup

The `bootstrap.sh` / `bootstrap.ps1` script handles all of the steps below automatically. Use the manual steps if you need finer control or are integrating with an existing environment.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Node dependencies for Tailwind (optional)
cd theme/static_src && npm install && cd ../..
```

### Database

The default development configuration uses SQLite — no database server required.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_taxonomy
SCD_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword python manage.py seed_admin
```

### Run the development server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The app is available at <http://localhost:8000>. Log in with `scd-admin@fnal.gov` and your chosen password.

> The development settings (`scd_reporting.settings.dev`) enable `DEBUG=True`, load Tailwind from the Play CDN, and log emails to the console.
>
> For CSS hot-reload during frontend work, run `cd theme/static_src && npm start` in a second terminal.

### AI Summary

To enable the AI Summary feature, export your Anthropic API key before starting the server:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...          # Windows: $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
python manage.py runserver
```

Without the key the summary button returns an error in the UI; all other features work normally.

To route requests through a custom endpoint (e.g. a LiteLLM proxy):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://litellm.example.org
export ANTHROPIC_SUMMARY_MODEL=azure/claude-sonnet-4-6
```

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing

# Run a single test module
pytest tests/test_entries.py -v
```

Tests use `scd_reporting.settings.dev` and an in-memory SQLite database. No external services are required.

Current baseline: **145 tests, all passing.**

---

## Docker Deployment

See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for the full OKD/Helm deployment guide.

Quick start for local Docker Compose:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set POSTGRES_PASSWORD, DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, SCD_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD, SCD_HOSTNAME
docker compose up -d
```

For OKD, use the deploy script:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh -t v01.00.00 -f my-values.yaml
```

See `./scripts/deploy.sh --help` for all flags.

## API

The REST API supports entry creation with Bearer token authentication. Tokens are managed from the user profile page (`/profile/`).

### Create an entry

```
POST /api/entries/
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "title": "My work this week",
  "description": "Markdown description of work done.",
  "project": "mu2e-daq",
  "category": "software-development",
  "period_kind": "week",
  "period_start": "2026-06-02",
  "period_end": "2026-06-08"
}
```

See `/api/` in the application for full request/response documentation and example scripts. Standalone submission scripts are available in `scripts/`:

- `scripts/scd-post-entry-json` — Python script (reads JSON from file or stdin)
- `scripts/scd-post-entry-json.sh` — Bash/curl equivalent

---

## Management Commands

### `seed_admin`

Creates the initial administrator account. Idempotent — safe to run on every deployment.

```bash
python manage.py seed_admin
```

Reads `SCD_INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `SCD_INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `SCD_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the environment.

### `seed_taxonomy`

Seeds the default set of projects and categories. Idempotent — safe to run repeatedly.

```bash
python manage.py seed_taxonomy
```

Additional projects, categories, and organisational groups can be created through the web interface at `/taxonomy/` (Admin role required).
